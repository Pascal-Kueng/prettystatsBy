Version: 0.1.0
Author: Pascal M. Küng
Maintainer: Pascal M. Küng <pascal.kueng@psychologie.uzh.ch>
Description: This package is a wrapper around the statsBy function from the
    pych library. Once loaded, this package replaces the statsBy function of 
    the psych package and extends the functionality.
    It adds correlation tables with indications of significance for
    both within-, between-, and combined matrices. This is done by infering the
    significance via calculating the confidence intervals using the three common 
    significance levels 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. These tables can be accessed via
    within, between, or combined functions
