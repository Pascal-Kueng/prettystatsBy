Title: Extending the 'statsBy' Funtionality of the Psych Package.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Pascal Küng
Maintainer: Pascal Küng <pascal.kueng@psychologie.uzh.ch>
Description: This package is a wrapper around the statsBy function from the
    pych library. Once loaded, this package replaces the statsBy function of 
    the psych package and extends the functionality.
    The function returns a statsBy object that retains all functionality 
    of the original object (psych package), while extending the functionality. 
    The function automatically calculates confidence intervals with the 
    alpha levels of 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 and provides formatted correlation 
    tables with indications of significance. All original calls and exact 
    confidence intervals for the alpha level provided to the function can 
    still be obtained via the regular functionality of the statsBy function.
